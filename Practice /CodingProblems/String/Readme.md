# String Algorithms and Operations

This repository contains implementations of common string manipulation problems. Each problem is solved with clear, efficient code and includes examples for understanding.

## Problems List

1. **Reverse a String**

### Basic Questions

#### 1- Write a function to reverse a string.
#### 2- Reverse a string without using built-in reverse().
#### 3- Reverse a string in place (without creating a new string).
#### 4- Reverse only words in a sentence (e.g., "hello world" → "world hello").
#### 5- Reverse each word in a sentence but keep word order (e.g., "hello world" → "olleh dlrow").

⚙️ Intermediate / Logic-Based

#### 1- Reverse a string using recursion.
#### 2- Reverse a string using a stack.
#### 3- Reverse a string using two-pointer technique.
#### 4- Reverse a substring within a given string (e.g., between indices i and j).
#### 5- Reverse a string but preserve the position of special characters (e.g., "a,b$c" → "c,b$a").

🧠 Advanced / Conceptual

#### 1- What’s the time and space complexity of your reversal algorithm?
#### 2- How does string immutability affect reversing in languages like Python/Java?
#### 3- How would you reverse a Unicode string or handle emoji/multi-byte characters correctly?
#### 4- How do you reverse a linked list of characters (concept extension)?
#### 5- How would you reverse a string stream (characters arriving one by one)?

🔒 Trick / Optimization

#### 1- How to reverse a string without extra space (O(1) space)?
#### 2- How to reverse a large file or stream efficiently (not just a string variable)?
#### 3- How to reverse only vowels in a string?
#### 4- How would you reverse a string recursively in tail recursion form?
#### 5- How do you reverse a string in functional programming style (e.g., map/reduce)?
