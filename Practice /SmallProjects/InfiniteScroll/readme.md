### Function Explanation

The `handleScroll` function is an event handler that is triggered when the user scrolls the page. Its purpose is to determine if the user has scrolled close to the bottom of the document, and if so, to load more images.

### Breakdown

1. **Destructuring Assignment**:
    ```javascript
    const { scrollTop, scrollHeight, clientHeight } = document.documentElement;
    ```
    - `scrollTop`: The number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled vertically.
    - `scrollHeight`: The total height of the document, including the content not visible on the screen due to scrolling.
    - `clientHeight`: The inner height of the viewport (the visible part of the web page).

2. **Condition Check**:
    ```javascript
    if (scrollTop + clientHeight >= scrollHeight - 5) {
    ```
    - This condition checks if the sum of the vertical scroll position (`scrollTop`) and the viewport height (`clientHeight`) is greater than or equal to the total height of the document (`scrollHeight`) minus a small offset (`5` pixels).
    - This means that the user is within 5 pixels of the bottom of the document.

3. **Load More Images**:
    ```javascript
    loadMoreImages();
    ```
    - If the condition is met, the `loadMoreImages` function is called. This function is responsible for loading additional images and appending them to the container.
